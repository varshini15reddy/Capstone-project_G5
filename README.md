# "SUPERVISION CAMERA ON WHEELS"

Purpose of this repository is to uphold all the activities and changes made to the capstone project. Capstone project repository will be in existence till the completion of the course "Embbeded Systems Engineering Design". Capstone project timeline is similar as the course timeline which would be for 4 months from May 2021- August 2021.

The contributors for the capstone-project_G5 repository are team of 5 who are Varshini Reddy Aenugonda, Rakshitha Nagapuri, Vamsi Nimmakayala, Vamshi Krishna Bandaru and Sai Swethan Banda.

Capstone Project is under the gudiance and supervision of Professor Dr. Mike Aleshams.

This repository contains certain files  as follows:

Project proposals: Multiple attempt of proposals were made to get good approach for the final project propsals. Frequent changes were made in the proposal to acheive the best outcome.

Hardware Components: Required hardware components are mentioned here. Where few additions and deductions of the components are made.

Code: Required software code and neccesary changes in the code made is imported in the repository.

Presentations & Report : For every acivity towards the milestone has a new presentation and based on the feedback few changes can be made.

PCB design & schematic capture: PCB layout and the required design , schematics of the project are also added to this repository.

# DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT
Security systems are in huge need these days. Spying on houses, workplaces , borders and military has become more important these days. Our project is supervison camera on wheels, which basically is the spy camera to monitor the threat. We use a raspberry pi whcih is controlled via an andriod bluetooth app and a 360-degree night vision camera for surveillance . This camera provides a live stream of the video that it captures whcih can be seen in an andriod app as well.We can access the video at anytime.We use the cloud storage in the app which is associated with camera which we are using. Metal detector is used to detect the threat and send an email notification. Temeprature is also measured using the sensor and notified. Location is also tracked by GPS and GSM modules.
